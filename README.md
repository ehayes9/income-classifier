### Project

As part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree, built a supervised learning model to determine whether an individual makes greater than \$65k per year (use case was for a charity organization to determine whether to contact an individual). 

Using SKLearn, built a LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier and Support Vector Machines (SVC) model, and evaluated, choosing the best performing model to tune hyperparameters. 

###Pre-processing

Pre-processing included normalizing, transforming skewed data and one-hot-encoding features 

###Evaluation

Evaluated models using fscore (weighted at 0.5 to emphasize precision, most important metric in this case as a false positive is more costly to a charity organization than a false negative). 
 
Also analyzed features importance & selection.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
